# **Change Machine**
<br></br>
## Objective
---
<br>

- Write a program that makes change for amounts less than one dollar. Input to the program should be a positive integer less than 100, representing an amount of money, in cents. Output should be the original amount of money together with a set of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, cents) that could make up that amount. The program should produce change containing the minimum number of coins required for the given amount. The output should be in a natural, non-stilted form. For example, input of 58 should produce output something like

>```58 cents: 2 quarters, 1 nickel, and 3 cents.```

- rather than

>```58 cents: 2 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickel, and 3 cents.```
